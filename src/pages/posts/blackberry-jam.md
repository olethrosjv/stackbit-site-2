This jam is meant to be canned. The lemon juice will be critical for preserving, but the amount of sugar can be adjusted.  It takes longer to cook down the berries than recipes with a package of pectin. There’s a lot of stirring but it’s worth it!

There’s nothing wrong with pectin.  Some people don’t have it on hand for a spontaneous jam-making session. Others don’t like the gelatinous texture. Jam made without pectin is a little softer and looser than jam made with pectin. It's more like a pie filling at the end of the day.
 
Lemon juice helps jam gel but with certain berries that are high pectin, it is not necessary for flavor, so much as it helps the preservation process when it is canned.  
If your blackberry jam doesn’t thicken, then you didn’t cook it long enough.  Be patient and turn the heat down as it starts to thicken to prevent scorching

### INGREDIENTS
- 6 cups fresh blackberries (remove stems, wash)
- 2 cup white sugar (granulated)
- 2 tbsp lemon juice

In saucepan, mix together mashed berries, sugar and lemon juice. 
Bring entire berry mix to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to low and cook until jam is thickened and reaches gelatinous stage, about 30 minutes. 
Prepare your canning jars by heating them in a pot of simmering water (180°F).  
Ladle the hot jam into the hot canning jars leaving ¼ inch headspace. 
Clean the rims and put caps on after jam has cooled, and you can handle the jars. Process the jars using the hot water canning method.

Can be held in unopened jars for 6 months or more.

Once opened, store in the refrigerator for 1-2 weeks.
