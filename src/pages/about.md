Canning is a way of preserving food that has been around for centuries. The food is processed and sealed in an airtight container that is stored at room temperature. Proper preservation can result in a shelf life ranging from one to five years. Under some circumstances, it can be much longer. A freeze-dried food product, such as canned dried lentils, could last as much as 30 years in an edible state. 
Interest in canning products has risen as the popularity of local and seasonal eating has grown. Canning isnâ€™t only possible for summer foods. Canned food such as citrus curd, marmalade, and pickled asparagus highlight food from colder months.
