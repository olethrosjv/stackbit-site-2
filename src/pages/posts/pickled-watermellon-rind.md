If you thought the watermelon rind was just for the compost bin, think again! This recipe takes what we usually discard when eating this summer fruit and makes it into a sweet treat. So the next time you are cubing watermelon for a salad or making it into melon balls, save the rind to make these pickles. 

### Ingredients

- 2 pounds watermelon rind  
- 1/4 cup pickling salt  
- 4 cups water (divided)  
- Â½ cup granulated sugar  
- 2 cups cider vinegar  
- 1 tablespoon of fresh ginger 
- 1 1/2 teaspoons ground black pepper 

### Directions

Gather the ingredients and trim the dark green and pink parts from watermelon rind. Cut rind into 1-inch cubes and measure out 7 cups. 
Put the watermelon rind in a large container with the pickling salt and 3 cups of water. Add more water to cover the rinds, if necessary. Soak overnight. 

Drain and rinse watermelon rind. 

Cover rind with cold water in a large saucepan. Meanwhile, in a nonreactive 6- to an 8-quart kettle or Dutch oven, combine sugar, vinegar, black pepper and ginger, and 1 cup water. Simmer the mixture 10 minutes. 

Strain and discard the solids. Then pour the liquid back into the pan. Add drained watermelon rind. Simmer the mixture until watermelon rind is translucent, about 30 minutes. 

Fill hot half-pint jars with watermelon rind and syrup mixture, leaving 1/2-inch headspace. Adjust lids. 

Process using the boiling water method for 10 minutes. 

Let jars cool on a rack
