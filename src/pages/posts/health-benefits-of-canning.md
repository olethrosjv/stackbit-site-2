Canned food can be as nutritious as fresh or frozen food. The most common foods to can are fruits, vegetables, beans, soups, meats, and seafood.

## Some people claim they contain harmful ingredients and should be avoided.

Research shows that this is not necessarily true. Canning actually preserves most of a food’ nutrients. Protein, carbs, and fat are unaffected by the process. Most minerals and fat-soluble vitamins like vitamins A, D, E, and K are also retained. Yet, since canning typically involves high heat, water-soluble vitamins like vitamins C and B , which are sensitive to heat and air in general, can be damaged. 

They may contain trace amounts of BPA a chemical that is often used in food packaging, including cans. Studies show that the BPA in canned food can migrate from the can’s lining into the food it contains. If you are trying to minimize your exposure to BPA, eating a lot of canned food is not the best idea. Canned foods may contain BPA, a chemical that has been associated with health problems like heart disease and type 2 diabetes. 

They may contain deadly bacteria known as Clostridium botulinum. Most cases of botulism come from foods that have not been canned properly at home. Botulism from commercially canned food is rare. Canned foods that were not processed properly may contain deadly bacteria, but the risk of contamination is extremely low. 

Some canned foods may contain added salt, sugar, or preservatives Some canned foods can be high in salt. While this does not pose a health risk for most people, it may be problematic for some, such as those with high blood pressure.

## Others say canned foods can be a part of a healthy diet.

There are three main steps to the canning process: processing, sealing, and heating. Processing happens when food is peeled, sliced, chopped, pitted, boned, shelled, or cooked. Sealing is how the lids are sealed to the sterilized jars. Cans are heated to kill harmful bacteria and prevent spoilage. This process allows food to be shelf-stable and safe to eat for 1-5 years or longer. 

While the canning process may damage certain vitamins, amounts of other healthy compounds may increase. For example, tomatoes and corn release more antioxidants when heated, making canned varieties of these foods an even better source of antioxidants. 

The availability of safe, quality foods is lacking in many parts of the world, and canning helps ensure people have access to a wide variety of foods throughout the year. Also, since canned foods can be stored safely for several years and often involve minimal prep time, they are incredibly convenient. Canned foods are a convenient and affordable source of essential nutrients.

Not all canned foods are created equal. It’s important to read the label and ingredient list.
