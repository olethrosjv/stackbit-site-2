A traditional drink of Southern planters, much like the mint julep, it was consumed daily. Much like a mimosa made of champagne and orange juice, this drink was often found on the breakfast table.

* ½ ounce of grapefruit juice
* ½ ounce of orange juice
* ½ ounce of grenadine
* ½ ounce of dark rum
* slice of orange and cherry

#### Directions

Into a cocktail shaker, pour light rum, grapefruit juice, orange juice, and grenadine. Shake vigorously for one minute. Fill a 12-ounce stemmed wine glass with ice cubes and pour drink mixture over the ice. Float dark rum on top of drink and garnish with a slice of orange and cherry.
