## Source Plugins

### Introducing GraphiQL

GraphiQL is the GraphQL integrated development environment (IDE). It’s a powerful (and all-around awesome) tool you’ll use often while building Gatsby websites. The GraphiQL Explorer enables you to interactively construct full queries by clicking through available fields and inputs without the repetitive process of typing these queries out by hand.

### Source Plugins

Data in Gatsby sites can come from anywhere: APIs, databases, CMSs, local files, etc. Source plugins fetch data from their source. E.g. the filesystem source plugin knows how to fetch data from the file system. The WordPress plugin knows how to fetch data from the WordPress API.

### Building Pages with  a GraphQL Query

Building new pages with Gatsby often starts in GraphiQL. You first sketch out the data query by playing in GraphiQL then copy this to a React page component to start building the UI.
