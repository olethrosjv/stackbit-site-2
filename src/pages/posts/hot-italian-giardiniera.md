These pickled vegetables were introduced to Chicago in the late 19th century by Italian immigrants and took their place as arguably the city’s most popular condiment. It’s used on practically everything! This is a version of Italian giardiniera. You name it, giardiniera is just what you need to bring your hot dogs, burgers, sandwiches, nachos, antipasto platters and pasta salads to life. In Chicago you’ll even commonly find it served on pizzas and, of course, no Italian beef sandwich is complete without it.

You can chop the veggies however you prefer. In Italy the vegetables are usually left in fairly large pieces and that way it’s also more versatile. Left in larger pieces you have the flexibility of serving the giardiniera with your antipasto and when you want to use it for sandwiches, hot dogs, pasta salads, etc, you can simply diced up the finished giardiniera into smaller chunks.

**Directions**

Place into a bowl the green and red peppers, Fresno chili, celery, carrots, onion, and cauliflower. Stir in salt, and fill with enough cold water to cover. Cover tightly and refrigerate overnight.

The next day, drain salty water, and rinse vegetables. In a bowl, mix together garlic, oregano, red pepper flakes, and black pepper. Pour in vinegar and olive oil, and mix well. Combine with vegetable mixture, cover, and refrigerate or can using the boiling water method.
