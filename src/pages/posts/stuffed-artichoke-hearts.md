## Story:

At one time, stuffed artichokes were the Italiansâ€™ best kept secret. There are many flavor variations to this dish, especially the addition of fresh herbs such as basil, rosemary, and oregano to the bread crumb mixture. This recipe, however, is a very simple rendition that is packed with flavor

### Ingredients

* 6 whole artichokes
* 6 cups seasoned Italian bread crumbs
* 3 cups grated Romano cheese
* 2 tbsps finely chopped garlic
* 3 cups olive oil
* S+P to taste

### Method:

It is always best to grate fresh Romano cheese for this recipe. The prepacked variety looses a lot of its flavor on the shelf, so you should avoid it when preparing this dish. In a large mixing bowl, combine all dried ingredients. Stir to blend the cheese and garlic in to the bread mixture. Season to taste using s and cracked p. Clean artichokes by clipping the tips of the leaves with sharp scissors. Cut large stems from the bottom so the artichokes will sit flat. Rinse artichokes well and press firmly down to spread open the leaves. Scrape the inside center of the artichoke down to the bottom, removing all purple leaves and pulp with a tbsp. Once the center is open, you may begin stuffing. Place one artichoke at a time into a bowl with the mixed seasonings. Start by filling the center, then each leaf from the top down, pushing as much into the leaves as possible. Continue until all six artichokes have been stuffed with equal amounts of the breading mixture. Place the stuffed artichokes in a large roasting pan with lid. Add enough water into the pot to rise about one inch off the bottom. Slowly pour half a cup of olive oil over each artichoke to coat well. Cover, bring water to a boil and reduce to simmer. Allow artichokes to steam in olive oil/water mixture for one to one and a half hours. Be careful that artichokes don not stick and scorch during the cooking process. Test for tenderness by one leaf from the center and testing for doneness. Serve one artichoke as an entree or split in half and serve as an appetizer.
